## Development Setup

This project uses **Bun** as the primary runtime and package manager.

### Lock Files

- **bun.lockb**: The primary lock file for this project (binary format, generated by Bun)
- **package-lock.json**: Gitignored to avoid conflicts

### First Time Setup

1. Install Bun: https://bun.sh
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `bun install` to install dependencies and generate `bun.lockb`

### Important Notes

#### Lock File Generation

The `bun.lockb` file is a binary file that can only be generated by Bun itself. When you run `bun install`, Bun will:
- Read `package.json`
- Resolve all dependencies
- Generate/update `bun.lockb` with the locked versions

**Note**: In CI/CD environments where Bun might not be available or crashes, you may need to:
1. Generate `bun.lockb` locally with `bun install`
2. Commit the generated `bun.lockb` to the repository
3. CI can then use `bun install --frozen-lockfile` to install from the committed lockfile

#### Using npm as Fallback

If you encounter issues with Bun on your system:
1. You can use npm instead: `npm install`
2. npm will create `package-lock.json` locally (this file is gitignored)
3. All `bun run <script>` commands work as `npm run <script>`

### Running the Project

```bash
# Development
bun run dev

# Build
bun run build

# Database operations
bun run db:push
bun run db:studio
```

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make your changes
3. Test with `bun run dev` and `bun run build`
4. Ensure `bun.lockb` is updated if you added/updated dependencies
5. Commit your changes including the updated `bun.lockb`
6. Submit a pull request

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Follow existing code patterns
- Run `bun run build` to check for type errors

## Testing

Currently, this is a baseline template. Testing infrastructure will be added in future updates.
